# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Killing Time!(Word Chain)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

In South Korea, we have a game name 'ggeut-mal-it-gi' it means if you type a word, and computer will ouput other word which is start with a letter that end letter of word that you type previouly. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In this project, I have to make a txt file which contains lot of words. So I googled some English words and copy and paste them into txt file. The amount of words will be over than 3000, so I have to use 'utf-8' function to open the big size files. Import random function to randomize the words that computer will output after the user type a word. Use Whife and If function because I have no idea what functions that I can use. So, I decided to use while and if which are more familiar to me. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think the good outcomes of my coding is simple. If I type a word, and computer outputs a word that starts with the letter that last word that I type previously. After that, If I type other world and the computer outputs other randoms word, it will be a good outcome for my project. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

It is hard to say whe is a better outcome for my final project....

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Fisrt, if only computer can play the game itself without human command, it will be a Best ourcome for my project. Seconed, I am using random function to print any words that qualify with my code, but if the next word does not overlap with the previous words that computer output, that will be a also Best outcome of my final project. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

If I want to make my code more ideal, the code line will be very long, so I want to learn which code can make my code line shorter that I can see the code more clearly. Also, I need more understand about while function because I already experienced lot of errors in while function part.
